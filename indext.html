    <h1>Hello Guvi</h1>
  
    <p>
        GUVI was started as a YouTube channel in 2011. The channel posted video tutorials, courses, and practice materials created by Arun Prakash, Sridevi Arun Prakash, and SP Balamurugan. The videos were posted in Tamil, Telugu, and Marathi, with the goal of reaching people not fluent in English.[2]

        The trio quit their job in 2014 and started GUVI as a company. Seeded with an initial capital of ₹1,000,000, the start-up was incubated at the Rural Technology and Business Incubator (RTBI) based out of IIT Madras. The start-up raised seed funding of ₹500,000, and officially launched in November 2014.
        
        GUVI received its first institutional round of funding of ₹10,000,000, from US-based Gray Matters Capital's edLABS in April 2019.[3] It raised ₹60,000,000 in its pre-series A round of funding from Education Catalyst Fund, an education-focused venture capital fund managed by CBA Capital, in April 2020[4]
